The prevalence of digital resources in education is on the rise, providing us with the means to measure and adapt various aspects of a student's education. 
EEdi is an online learning platform that leverages crowd-sourced math diagnostic questions to quiz students. It also allows students to indicate their confidence levels for each question. This repository focuses on the analysis of data collected from EEdi to explore the correlation between students' self-reported confidence levels and their learning behavior.

The results of the analysis can be found in the form of a report at [Analysis Report](https://github.com/Ayaan-Hashim/Analysis-of-EEdi/blob/main/Analysis_Report.pdf "Analysis Report pdf").

The code for the same can be found at [Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/Ayaan-Hashim/Analysis-of-EEdi/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb "Analysis.ipynb").
